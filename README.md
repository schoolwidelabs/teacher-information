## Getting Started
This page presents an overview of the technology used in SchoolWide Labs and provides
links to additonal information and tutorials. It also walks you through a series of exercises that will help you get started.

### Micro:bit
The micro:bit is a microcontroller created by the BBC for use in K-12 Education. It can be programmed using a variety of block and text based programming
languages. For the SchoolWide Labs project, we use MakeCode which is a block based programming language that also allows students to program in javascript and python as they become more advanced. Below is a suggested series of exercises to familiarize yourself with the micro:bit. Complete these exercises before moving on to the Gator:bit and sensors.

1. Go to [Makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org/)
2. Complete the Blinking Heart tutorial
3. Complete one additional tutorial
4. Complete one of the Games (e.g. Rock, Paper, Scissor or Hot Potato). 

### Gator:bit
The gator:bit created by [SparkFun Electronics](https://www.sparkfun.com/) makes it easy to access additional pins on the micro:bit as well as provide 
some simple options for displaying information using lights (5 neopixel LEDs controlled
by Pin 12) and sound (piezo speaker controlled by Pin 0). For more information on the
the gator:bit along with some examples see the [hookup guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-gatorbit-v2-hookup-guide).

### Sensors
The micro:bit comes with some onboard sensors including a magnetometer and accelerometer.
In addition the micro:bit has a light sensor and temperature sensor, but those are not 
sufficiently accurate for use in scientific inquiry. To better support scientific inquiry,
SparkFun developed a set of sensors that can be attached to the micro:bit and/or gator:bit.
These sensors include a temperature sensor, a light sensor, an environmental
sensors (measures temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, and total volatile organic compounds),
sound sensor, particle sensor, UV sensor, and soil moisture sensor. In addtion, a real time
clock and SD card can be attached to support long term data collection.

#### Magnetometer
The magnetometer can measure magnetic force in three directions (x,y,z) and calculate
the strength of the magetnic field. When you use the magnetometer block, the micro:bit
will prompt you the calibrate the magnetometer before taking values.
