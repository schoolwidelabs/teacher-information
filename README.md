## Getting Started
This page presents an overview of the technology used in SchoolWide Labs and provides
links to additonal information and tutorials.

### Micro:bit
The micro:bit is a microcontroller created by the BBC for use in K-12 Education. 

### Gator:bit
The gator:bit created by [SparkFun Electronics](https://www.sparkfun.com/) makes it easy to access additional pins on the micro:bit as well as provide 
some simple options for displaying information using lights (5 neopixel LEDs controlled
by Pin 12) and sound (piezo speaker controlled by Pin 0). For more information on the
the gator:bit along with some examples see the [hookup guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-gatorbit-v2-hookup-guide).

### Sensors
The micro:bit comes with some onboard sensors including a magnetometer and accelerometer.
In addition the micro:bit has a light sensor and temperature sensor, but those are not 
sufficiently accurate for use in scientific inquiry. To better support scientific inquiry,
SparkFun developed a set of sensors that can be attached to the micro:bit and/or gator:bit.
These sensors include a temperature sensor, a light sensor, an environmental
sensors (measures temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, and total volatile organic compounds),
sound sensor, particle sensor, UV sensor, and soil moisture sensor. In addtion, a real time
clock and SD card can be attached to support long term data collection.
